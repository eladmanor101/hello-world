# hello-world

Hi, I am just a newbie that started with C++ not too long ago.
I made some snake games, maze generators, sorting algorithms, the usual stuff you'd expect.

I recently started learning SFML, which is great for making graphics if you're new (Once you get past the set-up of course...).
I am also getting into classes and pointers right now, and they're actually really useful.

I might post some of my projects here on Github, but I am not making any promises.
